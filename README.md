# Crawler

* A general purpose web crawler implementation from scratch.
* Using Golang.
  * (I've think too much times to switch to JVM Language, But it's very
  hard to change my brain to JAVA.)
* Basically crawls a Web.
  * do not confused with scraping.
* Respects [robots.txt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt)
before attempting to browse.

## Why? Just using an API to Search!

* ~~Sigh~~
